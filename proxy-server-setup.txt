Installing on a clean Windows machine:

1) Install ruby
- Download ruby installer from http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/72085/rubyinstaller-1.8.7-p302.exe
- Run the installer; be sure the check the "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" checkbox.

2) Install mongrel and sinatra
c:\> gem install mongrel --version 1.1.5 --no-ri --no-rdoc 
c:\> gem install sinatra --version 1.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc 

2.1) Install other gems
c:\> gem install builder --version 2.1.2 --no-ri --no-rdoc 
c:\> gem install soap4r --version 1.5.8 --no-ri --no-rdoc 
c:\> gem install nokogiri --version 1.4.3.1 --no-ri --no-rdoc 

2.2) If running on a virtual machine, configure networking appropriately (Bridged networking or static IP)

3) Install the proxy server
- Navigate to http://github.com/sri-omg/halo_aura_proxy
- Click on the "Download ZIP" button, which in their current UI is a button that says "ZIP" with an image of an arrow coming out of a cloud.

3.1) Unzip the archive and move the project folder to the "halo" folder with the Aura client, server, etc.  Note: the project folder will probably be INSIDE the archive folder, named sri-omg-halo_aura_proxy-<some crazy hash>. Rename the folder to "proxy".

4a) To start the proxy server manually, first launch Aura. Then use the command line to navigate to the project folder and start the server using "ruby server.rb -p80"

4b) To start the proxy server along with Aura, use the "aura-server-startup-with-kb-and-proxy.cmd" script. Be sure to watch the startup: You will probably need to OK several security or firewall warnings. A Ruby command line window should open at some point and remain open; it will print messages if you are successfully talking to the proxy server.

5) Set the Halo app settings on the iPad to point at the IP of the server machine: set "Use custom host?" to ON and type the IP into the "Custom host" field.
